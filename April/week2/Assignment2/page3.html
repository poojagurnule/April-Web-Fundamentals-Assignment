    <h2>Why do we need a Front End Developer?
    </h2>
    <br>
    <P>A front end developer is the one who provides the shape and visuals to all that is happening at the backend. Without him, we would just be dealing with APIs all around. Imagine how weird it would be to have created a web site about mobile phones and purchasing them but not be able to view the phone pictures and only having a look at them in some form of getting or post APIs. A normal user would be required to have normal skills, and therefore a front end developer comes into play</P>
    <br>
    <h3>How is this Technology going to help you in Career Growth?
    </h3>
    <p>This is one of the technologies which is never going anywhere as every user will need visuals to make tasks easy and attractive. Only a front end developer has the above-mentioned capabilities and can make these things happen. It depends on the professional skills, of course, but if someone with an eye for detail and someone who knows what is wrong with the web site or if there can be any technological advancement to it can work wonders, and the possibilities are almost endless for him.
