    <h3>html</h3>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
         displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
          and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

          <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
              documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
              originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
              <p>An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several
                   types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).</p>
<h3>css</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
     written in a markup language such as HTML</p>

     <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
         This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification 
         of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
         in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
         .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its 
         formatting</p>

         <h3>JS</h3>
         <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.</p>
         <p>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)</p>
         <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

        </p>
        <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
